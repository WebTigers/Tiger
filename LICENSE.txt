# TIGER License Summary  

This license is subject to changes and updates without notice.

The goal of TIGER is to foster a new and exciting platform, community, and diverse eco-system for publishing and developing the next generation of web-based PHP applications.

To do that successfully, we need to set some ground rules and understandings. WebTigers has put literally thousands of hours and years of work into what has become the TIGER project. We worked very hard and long hours over many years building, tweaking, debugging, and developing, so that you wouldn’t have to worry about the minutiae of standing up a fully functional web application framework. 

Although TIGER utilizes various pieces of open-source software, the TIGER code itself is not “open-source”. Tiger is proprietary software made available for others to use, modify, and extend under license.

Your use of TIGER or any of the TIGER source code means that you agree to the terms of the TIGER License. If you don’t agree to our license, don’t use our code.

The TIGER code is made openly available so that others can freely write their own modules, plugins and otherwise extend TIGER’s functionality. It is not open-source and it is not free software that you can copy and use.

Purchasing a Tiger License is done when you instantiate a paid TIGER Instance or Container from AWS, Azure, or other TIGER partner platform partner. Once you have a paid license, you may use any TIGER code as long as that code remains within and part of the TIGER code base within a TIGER Instance or Container with a TIGER platform partner.  

# What you CAN do with Tiger

Instantiate a TIGER Instance or Container as a stand-alone website or web application.

Install and use free or paid third-party themes, modules and plugins that extend TIGER’s functionality.

Write free or paid themes, modules, and plugins that extend TIGER’s base functionality.

Create your own new Instances and Containers based on the TIGER instance or container code, as long as WebTigers is paid for the use of the base TIGER instance(s) and/or container(s).

Resell TIGER containers and instances with your own value-added code and technologies as long as WebTigers is paid for the use of the base TIGER instance(s) or container(s) your customers and clients use.

You may use any TIGER theme bundled with TIGER in your own end-user application(s). If you intend to re-sell your TIGER-based application, you will need to buy your own extended theme licenses from our theme partners.

You may re-brand TIGER as your own. TIGER is designed to be “white-label” software. As such, you can remove any “user-facing” copyright and branding to make TIGER your own fully-branded server instance or web application.

You may add your own copyright notices to your own code, such as within themes, modules, and plugins.

You may create as many images and instances of your TIGER-based application as necessary for the functioning of your application--but you will be billed for each operating instance; as will your customers and clients who buy your TIGER-based application.  

# What you CANNOT do with Tiger

Even though the TIGER source code is open for anyone to view, you may not copy this code and use it for your own purposes without purchasing a Tiger License.

You cannot copy and then alter any licensed TIGER code and then pretend you wrote it. It’s fine if you like our ideas and want to copy them, but write your OWN code.

You cannot use any licensed TIGER code outside of a TIGER Instance or Container, or outside of a TIGER platform partner, like AWS or Azure.

You may not remove any TIGER copyright notices, including client-side CSS and JS files.

You may not use TIGER code to create a competing product UNLESS when you are extending or enhancing the TIGER code base AND as long as WebTigers is paid for the use of the base TIGER instance(s) or container(s) you are extending.

Example: You created a web store or marketplace that integrates with TIGER as the base of your creation. You CAN now create your own SaaS server product as long as you replicate the TIGER instance as your new resale instance. This way WebTigers gets paid and you get paid and everybody's happy. Do note that your clients will be billed for TIGER and whatever fees you charge each month.

You may not create code that in any way attempts to interfere, disable, harm, or otherwise maliciously “mess with” TIGER’s core files and functionality or another 3rd-party theme, module, or plugin. DO create security plugins that help TIGER run more securely. DO NOT create a module that opens a security hole or backdoor into TIGER.

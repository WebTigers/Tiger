        <p>
            <code class="classname">Zend_Acl</code> was designed in such a way that it does not require any
            particular backend technology such as a database or cache server for storage of the
            <acronym class="acronym">ACL</acronym> data. Its complete <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym> implementation enables
            customized administration tools to be built upon <code class="classname">Zend_Acl</code> with
            relative ease and flexibility. Many situations require some form of interactive
            maintenance of the <acronym class="acronym">ACL</acronym>, and <code class="classname">Zend_Acl</code> provides
            methods for setting up, and querying against, the access controls of an application.
        </p>

        <p>
            Storage of <acronym class="acronym">ACL</acronym> data is therefore left as a task for the developer,
            since use cases are expected to vary widely for various situations. Because
            <code class="classname">Zend_Acl</code> is serializable, <acronym class="acronym">ACL</acronym> objects may be
            serialized with <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym>'s <a class="ulink" href="http://php.net/serialize" target="_top">
                <code class="methodname">serialize()</code></a> function, and the results may be
            stored anywhere the developer should desire, such as a file, database, or caching
            mechanism.

<a name="zend.acl.advanced.assertions"></a>Writing Conditional ACL Rules with Assertions</h3></div></div></div>
        

        <p>
            Sometimes a rule for allowing or denying a role access to a resource should not be
            absolute but dependent upon various criteria. For example, suppose that certain access
            should be allowed, but only between the hours of 8:00am and 5:00pm. Another example
            would be denying access because a request comes from an IP address that has been
            flagged as a source of abuse. <code class="classname">Zend_Acl</code> has built-in support for
            implementing rules based on whatever conditions the developer needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code class="classname">Zend_Acl</code> provides support for conditional rules with
            <code class="classname">Zend_Acl_Assert_Interface</code>. In order to use the rule assertion
            interface, a developer writes a class that implements the
            <code class="methodname">assert()</code> method of the interface:
        </p>

        <pre class="programlisting">
class CleanIPAssertion implements Zend_Acl_Assert_Interface
{
    public function assert(Zend_Acl $acl,
                           Zend_Acl_Role_Interface $role = null,
                           Zend_Acl_Resource_Interface $resource = null,
                           $privilege = null)
    {
        return $this-&gt;_isCleanIP($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
    }

    protected function _isCleanIP($ip)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>

        <p>
            Once an assertion class is available, the developer must supply an instance of the
            assertion class when assigning conditional rules. A rule that is created with an
            assertion only applies when the assertion method returns <code class="constant">TRUE</code>.
        </p>

        <pre class="programlisting">
$acl = new Zend_Acl();
$acl-&gt;allow(null, null, null, new CleanIPAssertion());
</pre>

        <p>
            The above code creates a conditional allow rule that allows access to all privileges
            on everything by everyone, except when the requesting IP is "blacklisted." If a request
            comes in from an IP that is not considered "clean," then the allow rule does not apply.
            Since the rule applies to all roles, all resources, and all privileges, an "unclean" IP
            would result in a denial of access. This is a special case, however, and it should be
            understood that in all other cases (i.e., where a specific role, resource, or privilege
            is specified for the rule), a failed assertion results in the rule not applying, and
            other rules would be used to determine whether access is allowed or denied.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code class="methodname">assert()</code> method of an assertion object is passed the
            <acronym class="acronym">ACL</acronym>, role, resource, and privilege to which the authorization query
            (i.e., <code class="methodname">isAllowed()</code>) applies, in order to provide a context for
            the assertion class to determine its conditions where needed.
